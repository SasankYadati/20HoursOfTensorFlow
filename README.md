# 20 hours of TensorFlow  
Update: 20 hours sounded enough. Bad estimate on my end. Since the goal is to be fluent and get familiar with advanced use cases of TensorFlow, I estimate it to take 70 hours.  
## TensorFlow in Practice  
Update: I have finished this course and the practice/assignment notebooks helped me get some hands on xp with different kinds of models in Deep Learning.

## TensorFlow: Data and Deployment    

## TensorFlow Live Project  
--Will update soon--
