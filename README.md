# 20HoursOfTensorFlow
20 hours of TensorFlow
<br>
1.1 6 hrs (actual)
1.2 6 hrs (estimate)
1.3 6 hrs (estimate)
1.4 6 hrs (estimate)

Update: 20 hours sounded enough. Bad estimate on my end. Since the goal is to be fluent and get familiar with advanced use cases of TensorFlow, I estimate it to take 50 hours.
